# ------------------------------------------------- #
# Define the rank titles players will receive as they level up.
# The plugin will check from top to bottom and give the player the highest rank they qualify for.
# You can add, remove, or edit as many ranks as you want.
#
# - 'level-required': The Force Level a player must be to achieve this rank.
# - 'display-name': The name of the rank. Use color codes (&a, &c, etc.) for style.
